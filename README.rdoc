== DESCRIPTION:

Daemon launching and management made dead simple.

With daemon-spawn you can start, stop and restart processes that run
in the background. Processed are tracked by a simple PID file written
to disk.

In addition, you can choose to either execute ruby in your daemonized
process or 'exec' another process altogether (handy for wrapping other
services).

== SYNOPSIS:

=== WRITING A DAEMON:

To create a new spawner, write a class that extends <tt>DaemonSpawn::Base</tt>
and provides +start+ and +stop+ methods. For example:

  class MyServer < DaemonSpawn::Base

    def start(args)
      # process command-line args
      # start your bad self
    end

    def stop
      # stop your bad self
    end
  end

  MyServer.spawn!(:log_file => '/var/log/echo_server.log',
                  :pid_file => '/var/run/echo_server.pid',
                  :sync_log => true,
                  :working_dir => File.dirname(__FILE__))

If you need command-line parameters, any arguments passed after one of
the commands (start, stop, status or restart) will be passed to the
+start+ method.

The <tt>spawn!</tt> method takes a hash of symbolized keys. At a minimum you
_must_ specify the <tt>:working_dir</tt> option. You can also override
the default locations for the log and PID files.

If you pass a <tt>:processes</tt> option to the <tt>spawn!</tt>,
daemon spawn will start that number of processes.

See the <tt>test/servers</tt> directory for working examples.

=== RUNNING A DAEMON:

Let's say that you have the example script listed above in
<tt>bin/my_server</tt>. Here are the commands for starting, querying
the status, restarting and stopping the daemon:

  bin/my_server start
  bin/my_server status
  bin/my_server restart
  bin/my_server stop

Note that if any additional arguments are passed to either
<tt>start</tt> or <tt>restart</tt> those will be passed to the +start+
method of an instance of your daemon class.
